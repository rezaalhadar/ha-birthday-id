# Birthdays-Reza
This is a HomeAssistant component for tracking birthdays, where the state of each birthday is equal to how many days are left. All birthdays are updated at midnight.

The Original Code is from :
https://github.com/Miicroo/ha-birthdays

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)
1. Go to integrations
2. Press the dotted menu in the top right corner
3. Choose custom repositories
4. Add the URL to this repository
5. Choose category `Integration`
6. Click add

### Manual
1. In your homeassistant config directory, create a new directory. The path should look like this: **my-ha-config-dir/custom_components
2. Copy the contents of /custom_components in this git-repo to your newly created directory in HA

## Set up
Set up the component:
~~~~
# Example configuration.yaml entry
birthdays:
  - name: 'Frodo Baggins'
    date_of_birth: 01-12-1988
  - name: 'Bilbo Baggins'
    date_of_birth: 22-12-2020
  - name: Elvis
    date_of_birth: 25-05-1977
    icon: 'mdi:music'
~~~~
Restart homeassistant

## Entities
All entities are exposed using the format `birthdays.{name}`. Any character that does not fit the pattern `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, or `_` will be changed. For instance `Frodo Baggins` will get entity_id `frodo_baggins`, and Swedish names like [`Sven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson`](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven-G%C3%B6ran_Eriksson) will get entity_id `sven_goran_eriksson`.

## Automation
All birthdays are updated at midnight, and when a birthday occurs an event is sent on the HA bus that can be used for automations. The event is called `birthday` and contains the data `name` and `age`. Note that there will be two events fired if two persons have the same birthday.

Sending a push notification for each birthday (with PushBullet) looks like this:
~~~
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: 'birthday'
    action:
      service: notify.pushbullet
      data_template:
        title: 'Birthday!'
        message: "{{ trigger.event.data.name }} turns {{ trigger.event.data.age }} today!"
~~~

If you want to trigger an automation based on a specific name or age, you can use the following:
~~~
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: 'birthday'
    event_data:
      name: Kalle
      # age: 40
    action:
      service: notify.pushbullet
      data_template:
        title: 'Birthday!'
        message: "{{ trigger.event.data.name }} turns {{ trigger.event.data.age }} today!"
~~~

## Lovelace UI
I use the birthdays as a simple entity list in lovelace, given the above example I use:
~~~
# Example use in lovelace
- type: entities
  title: Birthdays
  show_header_toggle: false
  entities:
    - birthdays.frodo_baggins
    - birthdays.bilbo_baggins
    - birthdays.elvis
~~~
